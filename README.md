# Mars-Exploration
The Mars Colonization Rover Project aims to upgrade the Mars exploration rover to become a colonization rover. It will gather resources, construct command centers, and deploy additional rovers. The goal is to establish a self-sustaining settlement capable of extracting resources and preparing for human colonization.
